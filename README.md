# CV19IV

R code - 2 main scripts permutation_low_ram.R which probability of overlap of an observed set of (in this case in vitro) mutations with the Spike amino acid replacements from the 3 current variant of concern (VOC) lineages (B.1.1.7; B.1.351; P.1)

spike_diversity_plotter_Gle_29.1.21.R plots observed mutations (both from VOC lineages and observed in vitro data) on a diversity map of Spike protein.
